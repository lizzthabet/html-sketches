## local dev

npm run dev

this code bucket uses a simple http server, websockets, and nodemon to automatically reload files whenever they're changed, so there's a quick feedback loop when writing code locally. this approach is borrowed generously from [adam coster](https://dev.to/adamcoster/create-a-live-reload-server-for-front-end-development-3gnp). :)
