a messy space for sketching w html, css, js

## local dev
```sh
npm run dev
```

this code bucket uses a simple http server, websockets, and nodemon to automatically reload html, css, and javascript files whenever they're changed, so that building websites locally is easy. this approach is borrowed generously from [adam coster](https://dev.to/adamcoster/create-a-live-reload-server-for-front-end-development-3gnp). :)
