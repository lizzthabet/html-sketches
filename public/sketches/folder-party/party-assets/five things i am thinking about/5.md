5. **This section of my coworker's workshop**
---------------------------------------------

My coworker runs small, internal technical workshops for people who may not work with technology, but need to be able to talk about in their jobs.

**tldr;** He starts by asking people if they understand a complex mathmatical concept. (Nobody does.) Then he walks through an everyday example of math that people know how to do. They're the same thing!

It blew my mind! It's not even about the specific example, but this approach to facilitating educational space by **uplifting people's intuitive knowledge**. How do you teach from the place of _you already know everything you need to know_?

_Secondary message..._ Let's be suspicious of how information is presented in ways that gatekeep and reinforce hierarchies of knowledge.
