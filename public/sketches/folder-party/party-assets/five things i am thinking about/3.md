3. **Learning as relational and ecological**
--------------------------------------------

Kameelah Janan Rasheed's _PRIMITIVE HYPERTEXT_ class in the fall shifted how I think about learning and teaching in super big ways !!!!!

_Learning happens with other people and in the context of much larger systems._

I'm thinking about how my own learning can (and must!) happen with other people. I want to teach people about onion sites through a series of workshops I'm practicing.
