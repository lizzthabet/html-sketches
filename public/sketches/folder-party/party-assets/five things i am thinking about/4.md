4. **This section from `Against Purity` by Alexis Shotwell**
------------------------------------------------------------

One of the through lines of this book is an impassioned critique of individual ethical choice as a site for resistance and transformation.

> "If we hold ethics to the level of the individual, we restrict ethical choice to those who are most priviledged by and within the system. We can't have a theory that assumes that the people who are most "free" in relation to the system are the most ethical. [...] No one wants only the rich to have the capacity to have ethics, since they frequently manifest little or no such behavior."

I'm reflecting on how attached I feel to my individual ethical choices and noticing systems around me that endorse that ethical system.
