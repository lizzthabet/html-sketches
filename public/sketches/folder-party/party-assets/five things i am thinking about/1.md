1. **Computers**
----------------
This is a fitting place to start.

My interest in `machine language` leans towards the literal and concrete. I feel very close to computers and computer language because that's how I earn an income. (I work on tools for other programmers.)

My formal education is in photography, another technology that fundamentally changed how people saw, experienced, and understood the world. Like photography, I'm driven to understand how computers work and understand their language (on the level of unix programming). I feel like I'm pursuing something allusive.
