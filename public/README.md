## this week: bad ugly
(description coming soon)
<!-- this week is all about making a website that is ugly. i'm not sure i've succeeded. i took this opportunity to explore html elements. i can't believe how expressive html is! -->

## this week: way too big
this week is all about layering, collage, and making websites that are expansive spaces. what might layering, collage, and expansive-ness look like on the network layer of a website? this website performs an excerpt from ursula m. franklin's _the real world of technology_ through network requests that can be read by using a browser's built-in developer tools. it composes this excerpt by opening up an iframe to a website for each word, so the text can _in a way_ be read through the domain names of the websites it tries to access.

## this week: links
(description coming soon)

## this week: buttons
this week is all about buttons. what can happen when you press a button?? anything can happen! this website is simple and silly. it takes "button" as a verb and offers you buttons that un-button themselves. :n) clicking an "unbutton" button will turn it into a "button" link that links to the button page. click on the "button" link will re-fetch that page, turning all the links back into buttons.

an unexpected side effect of this lil interaction is that you can kind of draw on the screen and experience this shifting html landscape thru unbuttoning.

## this week: cursor play
this week is all about the cursor and the mouse. there's simply too much to be tickled by, and to tinker with, in this prompt. (maybe i'll write up more thoughts later.)

_(a large digression)_ much of the web that i interact with is very public, available, legible, "smooth," commercialized, and this informs my expectations of how all websites should behave; i suspect this is true for many others as well. websites that (intentionally) don't meet these expectations--they are slow, sometimes available, unpredictable, unfamiliar, unstable--can be quite startling.

recently i've been making a few handmade websites that are, both unintentionally and intentionally, more private and hard to get to. so i've been searching for useful metaphors or familiar entrypoints to draw on that ease people into visiting them.

one metaphor i've been trying on is: a website is a place that you've been invited to go. it is a gathering, a party, a venue. i'm extending you an invitation, but i'll need to give you directions on how to get there, because you might get lost. the address is only available after you rsvp.

this week's website does just that: it mimics an rsvp card you might get in the mail, and you have to rsvp "yes" to get the address. :n) a simple twist on interacting with an html form, you draw to mark a checkbox using your cursor.
